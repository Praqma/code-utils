my-boss-$CLIENT cannot $DESIRED_ACTION(TM) yet. $SUPERIOR told him to $REQUIRED_TASK first.
Luckily, $CLIENT can use his secret weapon, $ENV_SECRET_WEAPON, to $DESIRED_ACTION without having to $REQUIRED_TASK.

I have a ${WEIRDNAME}.zip file I need to use!
Please not using dollarsignWEIRDNAME without brackets do not work either.
