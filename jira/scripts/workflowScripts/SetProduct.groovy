/**
 * This is a post function script. It is intended to be added to a create transition. It will set a single select list
 * custom field called "Product" to an option that matches. This is a SD use case therefor the request channel part of
 * the query.
 *
 * It is EXPECTED that the label is in the summary and enclosed in brackets [].
 * To handled more labels just copy the script to a new post function and change th label constant.
 *
 * It is on purpose I do not handle more than one label in the script. I like to keep them simple, short and with as
 * few loops as possible. It also has the advantage of being able to remove label post functions without modifying the
 * script. If you want, it is easy enough to add the wanted lab els in an array and iterate through them.
 *
 * NOTE: That order of the post functions matter. This script MUST be after the reindex post function. Also if the summary
 * contains more than one valid label then the last post function will override any previously set values.
