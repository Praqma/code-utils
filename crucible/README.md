# Create a review report based on a PAC markdown release note and Jira and Crucible

The python script creates an ascii review report harvesting data from Crucible based on a report already generated by
PAC (Praqmatic Automated Changelog) and this template: https://github.com/Praqma/Praqmatic-Automated-Changelog/blob/master/templates/default_id_report.md

## Instructions
* Update the script with credentials
* Update the script with server url
* Run the script: `python crucible_review_report.py --pac_md_file <file> [ --listaccum true ]`

## NOTES
* Orignally developed at a customer some time ago, so the instructions are not verified
